Revision history for Function-Parameters

2.001006  2023-03-27
          - Work around perl core issue GH#20950 (use re "eval" doesn't capture
            lexical %^H environment like eval() does and stringifies it
            instead) by downgrading the previous hard error to a warning (in
            the new category 'Function::Parameters') and switching
            Function::Parameters off in the affected scope.

2.001005  2023-01-27
          - Fix failures with perl 5.37.5 .. 5.37.6 caused by new internal
            opcode structure for anonymous subs.

2.001004  2023-01-20
          - Drop Dir::Self test dependency (use FindBin instead).

2.001003  2017-11-11
          - Fix threaded initialization issue better. This is the same issue
            that was fixed in 2.001002, but now we use PL_op_mutex instead of
            PL_check_mutex. This has the advantage of also being thread-safe on
            v5.14.

2.001002  2017-11-09
          - Fix crash when Function::Parameters is loaded at runtime by
            multiple threads (a stack overflow due to infinite recursion).
            This is arguably a core bug (RT#132413). The current workaround
            employed by Function::Parameters slightly abuses an internal perl
            mutex meant for something else (protecting op checkers), but it
            fixes the issue on perls v5.16 .. v5.26.
            v5.14 doesn't have this API yet, so the workaround is not thread
            safe there. It is technically possible to still run into this issue
            if two threads initialize Function::Parameters at the exact same
            moment (I haven't managed to reproduce this yet, so hopefully it's
            unlikely in practice).
            It is possible to completely avoid the problem on all versions of
            perl and Function::Parameters by making sure the module is loaded
            before the first thread is created.

2.001001  2017-07-12
          - fix duplicate type check on invocant:
                method foo(T $self: $x) { ... }
                # every call to foo() performs T->check($self) twice
          - clean up how type errors refer to parameters (now it's
            "parameter $N" for non-invocant parameters and "invocant $N" for
            invocants (or just "invocant" if there is exactly one))
          - rewrite pragma implementation and the way %^H is used
          - remove several internal package variables

2.000007  2017-05-15
          - no real code changes
          - extend bug RT#129090 workaround to perl 5.25.5
          - try to detect broken Moose installs earlier
          - fix declaration of developer dependencies

2.000006  2017-04-16
          - work around core bug RT#129090 / RT#131146 in perl 5.22 and 5.24:
            perl -e 'use Function::Parameters; \&f; fun f() { eval "" }' hangs
            in the compiler (also happens with perl -d or Devel::Cover instead
            of eval) (gh #29)

2.000003  2017-03-31
          - fix a bug where method modifiers would inadvertently declare subs
            (e.g. 'before foo() {}' acting like 'sub foo;
            BEGIN { &before('foo', sub {}) }'), breaking Pkg->can($method) and
            thus Class::Method::Modifiers (RT #120804)
          - make method modifiers take effect at runtime because otherwise
            you'd have to wrap every with()/extends() in a BEGIN block to make
            consumed/inherited methods visible to modifiers (RT #120804)
          - make method modifiers require a name (what would an anonymous
            modifier modify?)
          - (hopefully) improve the error message you get for trying to add any
            parameters after a slurpy

2.000002  2017-03-27
          - default to strict mode
          - allow types with multiple arguments (e.g. 'Tuple[Int, String]')

          - allow multiple invocants
          - support custom installers
          - implement Moo/Moose-style method modifiers
          - rework and extend import syntax
          - make implicit $self available in default arguments
          - call type reifiers from correct package and remove 2nd arg
            workaround
          - remove :(...) prototype syntax
          - remove undocumented 'attrs' option
          - drop internal Moo dependency

          - fix line numbers in runtime errors caused by calls with bad

1.0702    2015-12-21
          - fix parsing of _ in prototypes
            (caused bogus "Illegal character after '_' in prototype" warnings)

1.0701    2015-12-04
          - remove old "bare" import syntax:
              use Function::Parameters 'foo', 'bar';
              # equivalent to
              # use Function::Parameters { foo => 'function', bar => 'method' };
            (marked as deprecated in 0.06, no longer documented since 1.00)

          - fix string comparison bug (":lvaluefoobar" treated as ":lvalue",
            etc)

          - change "Not enough" to "Too few" in error message to match perl

            to be equivalent to "fun foo($x = 42, $y = undef)")

1.0503    2014-10-17
          - skip initializing parameters if the default argument is undef
            (don't generate '$x = undef if @_ < 1' for 'fun ($x = undef)')

1.0502    2014-10-16
          - fix bug that prevents building with threaded perls

1.0501    2014-10-13
          - support :prototype(...) for setting the prototype
          - allow fun foo($x =, $y =) (empty default arg equivalent to
            specifying undef)

1.0404    2014-10-13

          - 'check_argument_count' no longer controls type checks
          - new 'check_argument_types' property controls type checks
          - new 'strict' property does what 'check_argument_count' used to
          - new 'runtime' property lets you define functions at runtime
          - some more tests

            (https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=83439)
          - only allocate memory after recognizing a keyword like 'fun'
